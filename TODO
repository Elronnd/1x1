* Add (optional) IP tracking
* Add date tracking (by the day, to avoid exact-second correlation attacks)
* Make uploading files, as opposed to just sending strings work
* Optionally override content-type/mime-type
* Benchmark uploading and receiving files vs other popular pastebins -- are we the fastest?
 * I'm pretty sure that the way files are read is completely wrong but idk how to fix it.  Loading each character into a buffer and then sending each character from the buffer into the network seems wrong.
